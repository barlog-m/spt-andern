**Andern** is a mod for [SPT-AKI](https://www.sp-tarkov.com/)

Idea of this mod is to rebalance the game for better single player experience.

-   Gives PMC bots decent weapon from handmade presets.

-   Gives PMC good gear. Every PMC wear armor, helmet, rig, headphones, face cover and glasses.

-   Generates PMC with levels in configurable range.

-   Add trader that sell you couple weapon modules to make weapon until level 15 a bit less crap. And sells you keys for quests witch hard to find because of high randomness of loot in the game.

-   Mod allows to change Flea Market access level. Config parameter `FleaMinUserLevel`. You can increase it to level 42 to add more sense to looting because with Flea you can easy just buy everything your need for craft and hideout update.

Weapon and gear split by tiers. Tiers is described in `preset_name/preset.json` file. Mod has two presets _meta_ and _live_. Choise _live_ if you want more veraity and close to live Tarkov expirience.

You can disable PMC bot level generator with option `PmcLevel`.

You can disable PMC weapon generator with option `PmcWeapon`.

You can disable PMC bot gear generator with option `PmcGear`. Then mod only generate weapon.

Bots get random weapon from presets. Also, bots use specified ammo for each caliber from presets.

Preset made in the game and then exported with [SPT-AKI Profile Editor](https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/file/184-spt-aki-profile-editor/)

You can make your own preset. Just be sure that `ammo.json` contain record for weapon caliber.

Tactical device is not obligatory anymore.

At night raids tactical device replaced to infrared one.

At night raids all PMC wear helmets with night vision googles.

PMC wears gear from gear.json for their level.
